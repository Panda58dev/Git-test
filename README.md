# Git-test

This repository is a test one, it has several files, of which I use several as a draft, and script.php it is a small console program, the idea of which I borrowed from my friend @sheglov_official.

# Script.php

This program works quite simply: the user alternately enters data, they are written to a file and, if necessary, played back.

# Install and start

You need to download the file script.php, open the console in this directory and register:
`php script.php` (note that PHP5. 3 (and higher) must be installed on the device).

Otherwise, you can download the file `script.exe` (/Git-test/scr/script.exe) and run file. For it to work, you don't need to install PHP on the device.
