# Git-test

This repository is a test one, it has several files, of which I use several as a draft, and script.php it is a small console program, the idea of which I borrowed from my friend @sheglov_official.

# Script.php

This program works quite simply: the user alternately enters data, they are written to a file and, if necessary, played back.

# Install and start

You need to download the file script.php, open the console in this directory and register:
>php php script.php
At the same time, you need to take into account that PHP must be installed on the device.
